![Alt text](/img/screen.png?raw=true)

#

- We will set up Tailwind CLI and create a landing page from start to finish, going over many of the common utility classes.

- This is my solution to the [Manage landing page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5) using TailwindCSS

- Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

# Usage

Install dependencies (Tailwind)

```
npm install
```

Run the Tailwind CLI to compile the **input.css** during development. The output file is **css/main.css**

```
npm run watch
```

To build once run...

```
npm run build
```

You can edit the scripts in package.json and the tailwind.config.js file to change input/output locations
